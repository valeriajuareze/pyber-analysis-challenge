# PyBer Analysis Challenge

## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to summarize the ride-sharing data by city type in a DataFrame, then, with a multiple line-graph show the total weekly fares for each city types.

## Results
According to the results, we can dedude that there is a dependent variable which is the average per fare and driver; this, because it depends directly on the city type, which is the independent variable; more rides you have per week, less fares you have. Also, we can conclude that in the midst on february the fares increase regardless the city type, but, it is necessary to say that in the rural areas the fares tend to change more than in the other city types, which means that is unpredictable the people who will use ride-sharing on rural city.

## Summarize

Analyzing the results, I recommend to the CEO implement more publicity in the rural cities about the benefits of ride-sharing to increase the total rides per week, and to stabilize them. Then, I recommend him to increase the drivers in all city types to cover as much as possible rides demand. And finally, my last recommendation to him is to cut the prices in the first month of the year to increase the rides, this, because he will retrieve the money in the midst of february, independently the city type.
